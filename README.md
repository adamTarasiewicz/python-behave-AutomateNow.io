Automated Testing of Web Application - **AutomateNow.io**
# Python | BDD Behave | Selenium

To run all existing tests simply type: `behave` into terminal.

Run example: `behave features/[name of feature file].feature --no-capture` into your terminal.
Note: `--no-capture` is required for python's `print` function to work in terminal.

In this project, we will use the Python programming language, the BDD framework Behave, and the Selenium library to automate the UI testing of a AutomationNow.io web app.

We will focus on Sandbox tab only.

BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) is a software development methodology that focuses on defining the behavior of a system through examples. Behave is a popular BDD framework for Python that allows us to define test scenarios in plain English using the Gherkin syntax.

Selenium is a open source, powerful tool for automating web browsers. It allows us to write tests that interact with a web application just like a user would, clicking links, filling out forms, and verifying that the correct content is displayed.

By combining these tools, we can create a suite of automated tests that can be run automatically to ensure the quality of our web application.
I hope this description gives you an idea of how Python, Behave, and Selenium can be used together to automate the testing of web applications. Let me know if you have any other questions.

To get started, you will need to install Python, Behave, and Selenium. Then, you can clone this repository.
